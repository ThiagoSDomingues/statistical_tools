# 
# ### What Are Design Points?
# 
# Design points are strategically selected locations in parameter space where we run 
# expensive simulations (e.g., hydrodynamic simulations in heavy-ion collisions). These 
# points form the **training data** for Gaussian Process (GP) emulators.
# 
# ### The Challenge
# 
# Running full hydrodynamic simulations is computationally expensive:
# - Each simulation may take hours to days
# - We have multi-dimensional parameter spaces (5-10+ parameters)
# - We need enough points to train accurate emulators
# - We want to minimize total number of simulations
# 
# **Solution:** Smart design point selection maximizes information while minimizing 
# computational cost.

# ### Good vs Bad Designs
# 
# ```
# BAD DESIGN (Random clustering):     GOOD DESIGN (Space-filling):
#   ●●●                                 ●     ●
#      ●●                              ●   ●   ●
#         ●                              ●   ●
#   ●  ●●                              ●   ●   ●
#                                        ●     ●
# ```
# 
# ### Key Properties of Good Designs:
# 
# 1. **Space-filling:** Cover the parameter space uniformly
# 2. **Projection properties:** 1D/2D projections also space-filling
# 3. **Maximin distance:** Points not too close to each other
# 4. **Low discrepancy:** Uniform distribution (for quasi-random sequences)
# 
# ### Impact on Emulator Quality:
# - Poor design → large interpolation errors
# - Good design → accurate predictions everywhere
# - Adaptive design → focuses on important/uncertain regions
